        <h3> Discover the Value of Data with Anmut</h3>
        <p>At Anmut, we believe many organisations miss the true value of their data 
            because they donâ€™t see it as a strategic asset. Our proprietary methodology 
            values data not for selling, but for the value it drives within organisations.</p>
        <p>In this game, we've valued the data of FTSE 350 companies by sector.</p>
        <p>Select an industry card below and guess if its data value is higher or lower than 
        the starting industry given. If you're right, you win a point, and move to the next 
        round. Select another industry, this time comparing to the previous industry value.
        Keep going as long as you can! Best of luck!</p>
